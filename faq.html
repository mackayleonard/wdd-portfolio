            <h4 class="faq-question">What gear is essential for recovery, and what is not?</h4>
            <p class="faq-answer">Depending on the situation that you are in, you will need various products. In a simple situation where you are just stuck, a winch would be great, maybe needing a recovery rope and a shackle to give a tug and pull. But other things could happen such as a part breaking on your vehicle requiring more tools. A flat tire could occur, needing a compressor to air up again. Having everything for every situation is always a great option when you can have it! It is always better to have more than less</p>

        <section class="faq-section" id="faq2">
            <h4 class="faq-question">Which rope should I buy?</h4>
            <p class="faq-answer">It all depends on the weight of the vehicle that you are pulling! If it is a full size pick up truck, then we would recommend a heavier duty rope, if it is a smaller car, then a smaller rope would work great.</p>

        <section class="faq-section" id="faq3">
            <h4 class="faq-question">How should I recover someone?</h4>
            <p class="faq-answer">Pull as straight as you can once you are hooked up to their vehicle. Pulling at an angle could lead to the other vehicle potentially flipping if it gains traction. Along with that, you don’t need to pull too hard, pull at a speed of around 5 miles per hour, and try not to exceed that speed unless otherwise necessary.</p>

        <section class="faq-section" id="faq4">
            <h4 class="faq-question">What should the other person be doing during a recovery?</h4>
            <p class="faq-answer">Make sure that the other person is helping a little bit, but not much. The recovery vehicle should be doing a majority of the recovery due to the fact that the other person could sink and be spinning their tires if they do too much, which leads to them sinking more and making for a worse situation.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="faq-section" id="faq5">
            <h4 class="faq-question">What should I do after I am finished with a recovery?</h4>
            <p class="faq-answer">You should make sure that everything with both vehicles are okay. Inspect the recovery gear that you used, and make sure that everything is good to go for your next recovery, or your next adventure when a sticky situation comes up and your gear is needed!</p>
        </section>

        <section class="faq-section" id="faq6">
            <h4 class="faq-question">Why kinetic ropes and not tow ropes?</h4>
            <p class="faq-answer">Kinetic ropes allow for more flex when you are needing a tug. Tow ropes are more stiff and don’t flex, so pulling and putting more tension will allow it to snap. Kinetic ropes have a little bit more give in them.</p>
